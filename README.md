# Fonts (all with ligature support)

### • JetBrains Mono: [main site](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) | [github release](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/)

Pragmatic, no-frills, elegant design optimised for easy/fast reading.
Unique feature: rectangular characters allow eyes to smoothly scan through text.

### • Like JetBrains Mono, but with more "character" (less strictly rectangular character designs)

## themes

• [Noctis - by Liviu Schera](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) (light and dark)

Vibrant colours, distinct semantic highlighting, legible comments. Many great variations.

• [After Dark - by Simeon Kerkola](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ssmi.after-dark&ssr=false#review-details) (dark+)

Vivid colours, even luminance. Distinct semantic highlighting. Legible comments. Lacks colour for data constructors.

• [Atom One Dark Coal - by shiftybody](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#common_weight_name_mapping) (dark)

Soft colours, even luminance. Distinct semantic highlighting. Legible comments.

• [Monokai Pro - by Monokai original author](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode) (dark)

Very popular. Icon theme + Colour theme. Icon themes are nice (better than the bulit-in), can be applied separately from the colour theme. But significant shortcomings on its colour theme: does not distinguish module names by unique colour, nor data constructors; like 99% of themes on the marketplace, comments are too muted thus hard to read; free trial with occasional nag to pay.

• [Vim Theme - by HarryHopkinson](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HarryHopkinson.vim-theme) (dark; has light theme too but not good)

### built-in/pre-installed themes (the good ones)

Solarized {Light,Dark} | Tomorrow Night Blue (dark)

These are acceptable, with minor shortcomings. Solarized's colour for control flow keyword is too muted. Tomorrow Night Blue lacks colour for data constructors.

## extensions
