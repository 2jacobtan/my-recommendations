### • JetBrains Mono: [main site](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) | [github release](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/)

Pragmatic, no-frills, elegant design optimised for easy/fast reading.
Unique feature: rectangular characters allow eyes to smoothly scan through text.

### • Like JetBrains Mono, but with more "character" (less strictly rectangular character designs)

## themes

• [Noctis - by Liviu Schera](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) (light and dark)

Vibrant colours, even luminance. Distinct semantic highlighting. legible comments. Many great variations. [Extra luminance sometimes used for semantic highlighting.]

• [After Dark - by Simeon Kerkola](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ssmi.after-dark&ssr=false#review-details) (dark+)

Vivid colours, even luminance. Distinct semantic highlighting. Legible comments. [no colour for data constructors]

• [Atom One Dark Coal - by shiftybody](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#common_weight_name_mapping) (dark)

Soft colours, even luminance. Distinct semantic highlighting. Legible comments. [no colour for operators]

• [Monokai Pro - by Monokai original author](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode) (dark)

Very popular. Icon theme + Colour theme. Icon themes are nice (better than the bulit-in), can be applied separately from the colour theme. Some shortcomings on its colour theme: does not distinguish module names by unique colour; like 99% of themes on the marketplace, comments are too muted thus hard to read; free trial with occasional nag to pay. [no colour for data constructors]

• [Vim Theme - by HarryHopkinson](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HarryHopkinson.vim-theme) (dark; has light theme too but not good)

### built-in/pre-installed themes (the good ones)

Solarized {Light,Dark} | Tomorrow Night Blue (dark)

These are fine, with some quirks. Solarized's colour for control flow keywords is too muted. Tomorrow Night Blue has very bright font; [no colour for data constructors].
